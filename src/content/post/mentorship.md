_Inspired by Caleb and Claudia, the most amazing people I've ever met, and written for CMU's 2024 transfer application prompt: Consider your application as a whole. What do you personally want to emphasize about your application for the admission committee's consideration? Highlight something that's important to you or something you haven't had a chance to share. Tell us, don't show us._

I sit at the forefront of a library with four other panelists, patiently waiting for the ninety-five students to get seated. As the last student files in, the host, face lit by the twinkle of pendant lights above, launches into his introduction. Waiting for my turn to speak, I gaze upon the faces in front of me, each brimming with curiosity and anticipation. I remember the students from the game development classes I used to teach, their laughter and spirited discussions that echoed down the hall, and the sanctuary of knowledge we had created. As a microphone and outstretched hand appear in front of me, I am drawn back to the present. How many future innovators, entrepreneurs, and change-makers was I standing in front of? In their faces, I find my own inspiration, reminded of times when others illuminated my path.

I wonder if Claudia, a manager at Google and my biggest inspiration, feels the same way when she imparts her endless wisdom to me. Or if Caleb, my project lead at Nebula Labs, knew he was changing the trajectory of my life. Do they know the importance of the space they created, a space where, in their presence, no question is too trivial, no ambition too lofty, no mistake anything but a stepping stone for greater achievement?

It is because of them that I found my footing as a trusted teammate and an empowering leader; discovered joy in advising my underclassmen; and the reason I applied to be an Association of Computer Machinery (ACM) mentor this semester. As mentors, we are acutely aware of our role - not just as teachers, but as catalysts for change, inspiring others to dream bigger, reach higher, and shine brighter.

As lifeâ€™s most fervent mentor and mentee, I seek to inspire and be inspired.
